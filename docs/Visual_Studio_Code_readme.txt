Does Visual Studio Code use a embedded browser to render its UI (that is programmed with TypeScript)?

ChatGPT said:

Yes, Visual Studio Code (VS Code) uses an embedded browser-like environment to render its UI, but it's not a full browser like Chrome or Firefox. Instead, VS Code leverages Electron, which is a framework for building cross-platform desktop applications using web technologies (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript). Electron itself is built on top of Chromium (the open-source version of Chrome) for rendering the UI and Node.js for backend operations.

Here's how it works:
    Electron: It creates a desktop application using a web view (the Chromium engine) to render the UI.
        The main process runs Node.js to handle system-level operations (file access, running code, etc.).
        The renderer process is where the UI is rendered using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (in this case, with TypeScript).

    UI in VS Code: The UI elements, such as the editor, file explorer, sidebar, and panels, are all rendered using HTML and CSS (with custom styles) inside Electron's Webview (Chromium engine).
        Components are built using TypeScript and React.
        The UI is interactive and updates dynamically, using techniques like virtual DOM and event handling common in modern JavaScript frameworks.

    TypeScript: The UI logic, components, and interaction layers of VS Code are written in TypeScript, which is then compiled into JavaScript. TypeScript allows the developers to use modern features like static typing, interfaces, and classes, improving code quality and maintainability.
